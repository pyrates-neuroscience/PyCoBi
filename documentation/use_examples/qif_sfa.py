Hopf Bifurcation and Limit Cycle Continuation
=============================================

Here, we will demonstrate how to perform branch switching at an `Andronov-Hopf bifurcation <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Andronov-Hopf_bifurcation>`_
 and continue a branch of periodic solutions.
 QIF population mean-field model, which has been derived from a population of all-to-all
coupled QIF neurons in [1]_. The model equations are given by:

.. math::

    \\tau \\dot r &= \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi\\tau} + 2 r v, \n
    \\tau \\dot v &= v^2 +\\bar\\eta + I(t) + J r \\tau - (\\pi r \\tau)^2,

where :math:`r` is the average firing rate and :math:`v` is the average membrane potential of the QIF population [1]_.
It is governed by 4 parameters:
    - :math:`\\tau` --> the population time constant
    - :math:`\\bar \\eta` --> the mean of a Cauchy distribution over the neural excitability in the population
    - :math:`\\Delta` --> the half-width at half maximum of the Cauchy distribution over the neural excitability
    - :math:`J` --> the strength of the recurrent coupling inside the population
This mean-field model is an exact representation of the macroscopic firing rate and membrane potential dynamics of a
spiking neural network consisting of QIF neurons with `Cauchy <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution>`_ distributed background excitabilities.
While the mean-field derivation is mathematically only valid for all-to-all coupled populations of infinite size,
it has been shown that there is a close correspondence between the mean-field model and neural populations with
sparse coupling and population sizes of a few thousand neurons [2]_. In the same work, it has been demonstrated how to
extend the model by adding synaptic dynamics or additional adaptation currents to the single cell network, that can be
carried through the mean-field derivation performed in [1]_. For example, a QIF population with
spike-frequency adaptation would be given by the following 3D system:

.. math::

    \\tau \\dot r &= \\frac{\\Delta}{\\pi\\tau} + 2 r v, \n
    \\tau \\dot v &= v^2 +\\bar\\eta + I(t) + J r \\tau - a - (\\pi r \\tau)^2, \n
    \\tau_a \\dot a &= -a + \\alpha \\tau_a r,

where the evolution equation for :math:`a` expresses a convolution of :math:`r` with a mono-exponential kernel, with
adaptation strength :math:`\\alpha` and time constant :math:`\\tau_a`.

In the sections below, we will demonstrate for each model how to load the model template into pyrates, perform
simulations with it and visualize the results.

# %%
# Step 1: Model Initialization
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Let's begin by loading the QIF SFA mean-field model into `PyCoBi`:

from pycobi import ODESystem
import numpy as np

ode = ODESystem.from_yaml(
    "model_templates.neural_mass_models.qif.qif_sfa", auto_dir="~/PycharmProjects/auto-07p",
    node_vars={'p/qif_sfa_op/Delta': 2.0, 'p/qif_sfa_op/alpha': 1.0, 'p/qif_sfa_op/eta': 3.0},
    edge_vars=[('p/qif_sfa_op/r', 'p/qif_sfa_op/r_in', {'weight': 15.0*np.sqrt(2.0)})],
    NPR=100, NMX=30000
)

# %%
# In the code above, we adjusted some default parameters of the model in accordance with the parameters reported
# in [1]_. Also, an initial integration of the ODE system with respect to time was performed, such that the system
# was able to converge to a steady-state solution. Let's examine whether the system did indeed converge to a
# steady-state solution.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
ode.plot_continuation("PAR(14)", "U(1)", cont=0)
plt.show()

# %%
# If the system didn't converge yet, try increasing the parameter :code:`NMX` provided to the :code:`ODESystem.from_yaml`
# method, which controls the number of time integration steps, until the system is assumed to have converged.

# %%
# Step 2: 1D parameter continuation of a steady-state solution
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# A 1D parameter continuation in :math:`\bar \eta` can be carried out as follows:

eta_sols, eta_cont = ode.run(
    origin=0, starting_point='EP', name='eta', bidirectional=True,
    ICP=4, RL0=-20.0, RL1=20.0, IPS=1, ILP=1, ISP=2, ISW=1, NTST=400,
    NCOL=4, IAD=3, IPLT=0, NBC=0, NINT=0, NMX=2000, NPR=10, MXBF=5, IID=2,
    ITMX=40, ITNW=40, NWTN=12, JAC=0, EPSL=1e-06, EPSU=1e-06, EPSS=1e-04,
    DS=1e-4, DSMIN=1e-8, DSMAX=5e-2, IADS=1, THL={}, THU={}, UZR={4: 3.0}, STOP={}
)

# %%
# In the above code, we provided all the `auto-07p` meta parameters as keyword arguments. As an alternative, you can
# create constants file with name :code:`c.name` and provide it to :code:`ODESystem.run` via keyword argument
# :code:`c=name`. See the `auto-07p documentation <https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p/doc>`_ for a detailed explanation
# of each of these parameters.
# The following keyword arguments are specific to `PyCoBi` and deviate from standard `auto-07p` syntax:
# :code:`bidirectional = True` leads to automatic continuation of the solution branch into both directions of the
# continuation parameter :math:`\bar \eta`. :code:`origin` indicates the key of the solution branch, where a solution with
# the name :code:`starting_point='EP'` exists, which is used as the starting point of the parameter continuation.
# We can plot the results of the 1D parameter continuation, to examine the results.

ode.plot_continuation("PAR(4)", "U(1)", cont="eta")
plt.show()

# %%
# The plot shows a 1D bifurcation diagram in the state variable :math:`r` as a function of the continuation parameter
# :math:`\bar \eta`. Solid lines indicate stable solutions of the system, whereas dotted lines indicate unstable
# solutions. We can see that the steady-state solution branch undergoes a number of bifurcations,
# marked by the green circles (`Hopf bifurcations <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Andronov-Hopf_bifurcation>`_)
# and grey triangles (`fold bifurcations <http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Saddle-node_bifurcation>`_),
# at which the stability of the solution branch changes.

# %%
# Step 3: Branch switching at a Hopf bifurcation to the limit cycle solutions
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# We know from bifurcation theory that the Hopf bifurcation at :math:`\bar \eta \approx 4` is a subcritical Hopf
# bifurcation, and that an unstable limit cycle branch must emerge from that bifurcation. We can switch to this branch
# and continue the limit cycle solution curve as follows.

hopf_sols, hopf_cont = ode.run(
    origin=eta_cont, starting_point='HB2', name='eta_hopf',
    IPS=2, ISP=2, ISW=-1, UZR={4: -2.0}
)

# %%
# Let's visualize the 1D bifurcation diagram again, this time with the limit cycle branch included:

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ode.plot_continuation("PAR(4)", "U(1)", cont="eta", ax=ax)
ode.plot_continuation("PAR(4)", "U(1)", cont="eta_hopf", ax=ax)
plt.show()

# %%
# As we can see, the limit cycle solution curve that branches off the Hopf bifurcation is indeed unstable.
# However, it undergoes a fold-of-limit-cycle bifurcation, giving rise to a stable limit cycle solution branch.
# During continuation of the limit cycle branch, we set a user point at :math:`\bar \eta = 2.0` via
# :code:`UZR={4: -2.0}`. In the code below, we integrate the system equations with respect to time to show that the
# system dynamics are indeed governed by the stable limit cycle solution in that regime.

ode.run(origin=hopf_cont, starting_point="UZ1", c="ivp", name="lc")
ode.plot_continuation("PAR(14)", "U(1)", cont="lc")
plt.show()

# %%
# This concludes our use example. As a final step, we clear all the temporary files we created and make sure all
# working directory changes that have happened in the background during file creation and parameter continuation are
# undone. This can be done via a single call:

ode.close_session(clear_files=True)

# %%
# If you want to keep the Fortran files for future parameter continuations etc., just set :code:`clear_files=False`.
